=over 4

=item selfServiceAccess

Returns 'Yes' or 'No' to signify whether the employee is able to login
to the BambooHR service.

=item terminationType

Returns one of 'Death', 'Voluntary', or 'Involuntary'. When someone is marked
as terminated via the user interface, it is optional to specify the termination type.
If not specified this will return C<undef>.

=item terminationReason

This might be one of the standard reasons
('Attendance', 'Other employment', 'Performance', or 'Relocation'),
but it may also be a custom string that was entered by the person who recorded
the termination.
